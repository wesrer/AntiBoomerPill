What code, if any, would you especially like the course staff to
review?  Why?

<<<<<<< HEAD
  -In codegen, we don't know if we dealt with the vmop cases correctly
  for forEffect and toReg. We are not sure if we have to change our let 
  cases in codegen to be more complicated. Something is wrong with our projection function 
  that causes 
  uft kn-vo fact.kn | svm
  to  fail and we are not sure why. We also have no idea why our translation to 
  knf didnt work for our two test cases, overtail.kn and tailm.kn.
