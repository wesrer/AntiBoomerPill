What code would you like help improving?  Are there bugs you'd like
help finding during code review?

<<<<<<< HEAD
  - We are unsure how to cache the program state for performance.
  We would like help deciding how many registers to cache, and what
  data we should store in local C variables.

  - What would you like the instructor to present at the code review?
    (Ideally, choose some distributed code that you don't understand
    or would like clarificationÂ on.)
<<<<<<< HEAD
    We would like to see instructions involving cons cells because we didn't
    get a chance to work through that. We would also like to see other ways of
    dealing with booleans (we chose a very strict representation).
