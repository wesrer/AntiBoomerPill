COMP 150VM Homework Submission
What person or group is submitting this homework?
  Sayak Chatterjee and Aditi Kocherlakota
What work are you proud of?
  Closure Convert and implement LETREC in codegen
What code would you like help improving?  Are there bugs you'd like
help finding during code review?
  Yes. We could not get our closure-convert letrec case working. (step 21)
What code, if any, would you especially like the course staff to
review?  Why?
  1. letrec function in codegen.sml
  2. how to debug this error:
  ../../bin/uft ho-kn ../../tests/qsort.scm | ../../bin/vscheme.opt

In this course, all code may be shared freely.  Aside from code that
is distributed with the assignment, does your submission contain any
other code that you got from someone else?  If so, what code is it
(file names and line numbers please) and who supplied it?

  We worked collaboratively with Mert Erden and Lulu Zheng on the Letrec portion: 
  line 83 of closure-convert
  121-135 of knormalize.sml
  and with Janny Huang on closure convert

In response to last week's code review, have you made any material
changes?  What were they?  By file name and line number, where are
they found in the code?  If you remember, who helped you during code
review?

  yes- we changed F.LET to use removeRegs on line 87 of knormalize.sml

We have a plenary code review tomorrow.  Are you willing to present
(as a group, if applicable)?
  Yes
Supposing you are not selected to present at tomorrow's plenary code
review, what code would you like to see presented?  What would you
learn the most from?
  Letrec
Again supposing you are not selected to present, who in your group is
willing to serve on the review panel?
  Sayak Chatterjee, Aditi Kocherlakota
