COMP 150VM Homework Submission

What person or group is submitting this homework?

  Aditi Kocherlakota and Emily Gheewalla

What work are you proud of?

  - our parser!

What code would you like help improving?  Are there bugs you'd like
help finding during code review?

  - nil case for parsing literals, and unparsing literals. 

What code, if any, would you especially like the course staff to
review?  Why?

  - unparse1 (handling of literals), function loading parser,
   our nil case for parsing literals, labelElim,
   because we're not sure if they are right.

In this course, all code may be shared freely.  Aside from code that
is distributed with the assignment, does your submission contain any
other code that you got from someone else?  If so, what code is it
(file names and line numbers please) and who supplied it?

  - We worked closely with Janny for labelElim, since Aditi and Janny worked
  together for lab all of the code is the same. Lines of code in assembelr.sml.

In response to last week's code review, have you made any material
changes?  What were they?  By file name and line number, where are
they found in the code?  If you remember, who helped you during code
review?

  - We talked to Ben and janny about unparse.


We have a plenary code review tomorrow.  Are you willing to present
(as a group, if applicable)?

  - Sure!

Supposing you are not selected to present at tomorrow's plenary code
review, what code would you like to see presented?  What would you
learn the most from?

  -  labelElim, another look at unparse, and all of the parsing combinators

Again supposing you are not selected to present, who in your group is
willing to serve on the review panel?

  - We both are!
