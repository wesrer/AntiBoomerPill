COMP 150VM Homework Submission

What person or group is submitting this homework?

  - Aditi & Sayak

What work are you proud of?

  - our return function

What code would you like help improving?  Are there bugs you'd like
help finding during code review?

  - everything in codegen. also we want to review projection functions.

What code, if any, would you especially like the course staff to
review?  Why?

  -In codegen, we don't know if we dealt with the vmop cases correctly
  for forEffect and toReg. We are not sure if we have to change our let 
  cases in codegen to be more complicated. Something is wrong with our projection function 
  that causes 
  uft kn-vo fact.kn | svm
  to  fail and we are not sure why. We also have no idea why our translation to 
  knf didnt work for our two test cases, overtail.kn and tailm.kn.

In this course, all code may be shared freely.  Aside from code that
is distributed with the assignment, does your submission contain any
other code that you got from someone else?  If so, what code is it
(file names and line numbers please) and who supplied it?

  - none

In response to last week's code review, have you made any material
changes?  What were they?  By file name and line number, where are
they found in the code?  If you remember, who helped you during code
review?

  - yes, we need to change our vmrun to check  the
  arity for tail calls as well.
