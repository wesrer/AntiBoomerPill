COMP 150VM Homework Submission

What person or group is submitting this homework?

  - Aditi Kocherlakota and Emily Gheewalla

What work are you proud of?

  Our thought process behind unparse1.

What code would you like help improving?  Are there bugs you'd like
help finding during code review?

  - We're unsure if our unparse function works correctly for both cases.

What code, if any, would you especially like the course staff to
review?  Why?

  -unparse, our grammar, and our attempt and loadliteral for step 18

In this course, all code may be shared freely.  Aside from code that
is distributed with the assignment, does your submission contain any
other code that you got from someone else?  If so, what code is it
(file names and line numbers please) and who supplied it?

  - code in unparse inspired by Danielle Lan. File: asmparse.sml

In response to last week's code review, have you made any material
changes?  What were they?  By file name and line number, where are
they found in the code?  If you remember, who helped you during code
review?

  - Not this time!


We have a plenary code review tomorrow.  Are you willing to present
(as a group, if applicable)?

  - Sure

Supposing you are not selected to present at tomorrow's plenary code
review, what code would you like to see presented?  What would you
learn the most from?

  - unparse

Again supposing you are not selected to present, who in your group is
willing to serve on the review panel?

  - Both of us!
