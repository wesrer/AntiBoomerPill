COMP 150VM Homework Submission

What person or group is submitting this homework?

  Aditi Kocherlakota, Emily Gheewalla

Not counting code that was distributed to everyone, what code was
contributed by other persons or groups?  Who were the contributors?

  None

What work are you proud of?

  We are proud of our move instruction, because it made writing tests 
  easier.

What code would you like help improving?  Are there bugs you'd like
help finding during code review?

  - We are unsure how to cache the program state for performance.
  We would like help deciding how many registers to cache, and what
  data we should store in local C variables.

What code, if any, would you especially like the course staff to
review?  Why?

  - Our control flow in vmrun to see if there is anything
  that could be improved for performance.

For the first module, the instructor will present at a plenary code
review.

  - In your group, who is willing to serve on the review panel?
    Aditi

  - What would you like the instructor to present at the code review?
    (Ideally, choose some distributed code that you don't understand
    or would like clarificationÂ on.)
    We would like to see instructions involving cons cells because we didn't
    get a chance to work through that. We would also like to see other ways of
    dealing with booleans (we chose a very strict representation).
