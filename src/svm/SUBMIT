Not counting code that was distributed to everyone, what code was
contributed by other persons or groups?  Who were the contributors?

  - None

What work are you proud of?

  - I enjoyed writing the projectbool instruction!

What code would you like help improving?  Are there bugs you'd like
help finding during code review?

  - couldn't free all memory correctly

What code, if any, would you especially like the course staff to
review?  Why?

  -loadfun- not sure if I implemented maxgrep correctly.

In this course, all code may be shared freely.  Aside from code that
is distributed with the assignment, does your submission contain any
other code that you got from someone else?  If so, what code is it
(file names and line numbers please) and who supplied it?

  - Nope

In response to last week's code review, have you made any material
changes?  What were they?  By file name and line number, where are
they found in the code?  If you remember, who helped you during code
review?

  - I cached the registers on line 34 of vmrun.c. Ben and Lulu helped
	me last week.


We have a plenary code review tomorrow.  Are you willing to present
(as a group, if applicable)?

  - Sure!

Supposing you are not selected to present at tomorrow's plenary code
review, what code would you like to see presented?  What would you
learn the most from?

  - I'd like to see an alternate representation of literal_slot that allows for no
	space to be wasted.

Again supposing you are not selected to present, who in your group is
willing to serve on the review panel?

  - I can!
