What code, if any, would you especially like the course staff to
review?  Why?

<<<<<<< HEAD
  - when we run 
      uft fo-vo fopredef.scm scheme105.scm | svm
    we get an 
    InternalError: primitive error used for value
    and we are not sure why because we implemented error in vmrun.c. we would 
    love help with this. If we only leave the mirror function in, we get
    unimplemented opcode. And we are not sure why.
